EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Cognitive Development Theories Chart	N/A	Assignment Comments	Plagairism 			I cannot grade this. I tried but the task is for you to write in your own words the definitions. Not copy what I wrote on the slides and change every third word. Eventually you are bound to make a mistake and copy three words in a row. I stopped grading at Vygostky when you copied more than three words in a row.   When  you copy what I wrote and just change a few words around it also makes me work 2x harder because now I have to read my own notes to verify you did not copy vs. me just checking to see if you understand the material.  I put a 0 to grab your attention and provide you with an opportunity to  resubmit the assignment. You can still earn full credit. I am sure this  was not intentional and I don't mean to upset you. I want you to be the  best student you can be. Therefore, if you need help or want to talk  about this please let me know. Please also check your other assignments like the Video Case Study and Blog 1 to make sure you did not make the same mistake with the other definitions. You can resubmit via replying in a comment below.   Thanks, James

If I did write a comment it is because your peer's comment may be incorrect or need additional clarification.	
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	CSLPA Final Paper	Any	Attribution Theory	Missing definition and application were not sufficient			Missing definition of components (mentioning the scale is not a sufficient definition). Not all the application of components were accurate. The first examples were and then the second examples got a bit confusing.		-2.5
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	CSLPA Final Paper	Any	Behaviorism	incomplete/inaccurate definition			Good improvements but operant conditioning's definition was still not quite complete/accurate and the application of did not explain what was being added as a reward for what behavior.		-2.5
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	CSLPA Section 1 Draft	Any	Behaviorism	Don't use classical conditioning			Technically I wanted you to apply two concepts from operant conditioning not classical- because although this is a good example, its more contiguity and not classical- because there isn't a unconditioned response being associated- like salivating etc.

EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Cognitive Development Theories Chart	N/A	Criticism of Theories	Criticisms are not distinct			Technically these are criticisms of the same problem.

EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Blog 1	N/A	Description of the theory components.	Contiguity definition			No need to describe Contiguity. 		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Blog 1	N/A	Description of the theory components.	Classical Conditioning			Please briefly describe classical conditioning  and maybe just say its not often used in classrooms. 		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Blog 1	N/A	Description of the theory components.	Operant Conditioning			The definition of operant conditioning was great. Just be a little more specific that the student desires/does not desire consequence and teacher desires/does not desire the behavior. 		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Blog 1	N/A	Description of the theory components.	Operant Conditioning			Your definition of operant conditioning is good just needs to include the different types of +- reinforcement and punishment in detail explaining who behavior is desired by, and who desires the response. Typically its separate sentences for each.		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Blog 1	N/A	Description of the theory components.	Operant Conditioning			This was close! You accurately used contiguity but its not a key component. Please use Operant conditioning and  explain how learning example is +/- reinforcement or punishment. And this needs to be done for 2-3 different types of consequences.		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Blog 5	N/A	Description of the theory components.	Achievement goal theory components are incorrect			Close on Achievement goal components.

In “Love”, psychologists took brain scans of multiple infants, taking specifically into account how responsive and caring each child’s caregivers were.

EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Video Case Study	Babies	Description of Theory (Parenting Styles or Peer Influence)	Applying Parenting Styles			Authoritative parenting is exhibited by Anne, who is hesitant and fearful about her children engaging in certain activities, but still allows them the freedom to make the choice themselves. In this instance, Anne allows her children to go ziplining, but under the condition that she is there observing and ensuring that they are safely secure

EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	CSLPA Section 1 Draft	Any	Introduction	Missing Key Components			This is a great start. Please tell me what subject and grade is this class and what is the learning objective. You provided the objective of Mr. Johnson but what about what he wants the students to learn?		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	CSLPA Section 1 Draft	Any	Introduction	For Next Draft			For draft 2 you will add a sentence stating you will also analyze using motivational theories and list those too.		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	CSLPA Section 1 Draft	Any	Introduction	Active first person			write in first person and tell me what you are doing in this paper.

EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Cognitive Development Theories Chart	N/A	Key Components of the Theories	Plagairism			use your own words. How else can you say "cognitive discomfort", confusion? I want you to use main terms but when describing the terms you sometimes want to use your own words. It's a delicate balance.		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Cognitive Development Theories Chart	N/A	Key Components of the Theories	ZPD definition			The way this is stated is contradictory. It's easy enough for the student to try, but challenging enough that they need assistance. Just not too challenging where even with assistance they cannot complete the task.		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Cognitive Development Theories Chart	N/A	Key Components of the Theories	Same Schema			Yes, and the new info has to be changed to fit existing schema		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Cognitive Development Theories Chart	N/A	Learner's Perspective				Be careful not to write general statements like this. Use the terms. A general rule is if the sentence could be said of any theory it needs to be more specific.		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Cognitive Development Theories Chart	N/A	Learner's Perspective				To provide a specific example, use a subject and topic. Like Math and then adding two digit numbers.		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	CSLPA Final Paper	Any	Section 3 - Alternative Strategies for ELLs: Theory-Based Suggestions	Missing connection to specific lesson			Suggestion 1 was from the DOE and well applied. Just missing connection to this specific lesson. 3.5/4		-0.5

EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Cognitive Development Theories Chart	N/A	Teacher's Role				You don't necessarily want to teach these concepts "at an early age" you want to support the children's understanding of those concepts only when they are ready to learn them (according to Piaget).		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	Cognitive Development Theories Chart	N/A	Teacher's Role	Piaget- teachers stimulate development			I am seeing this misconception in a number of students' assignments. Piaget believed you development occurs regardless of the social transmission. However, social transmission can help the process but not "stimulate" it. Therefore, teachers teach concepts only when students are at the appropriate developmental stage (according to Piaget). In real life, teachers should be aware that some concepts "might" be challenging for students are certain development stages and should be mindful when they are teaching those concepts. But that teachers should not limit their children. 		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	CSLPA Final Paper	Any	Theory-Based Suggestions	Missing definition of component			Suggestion 1 was missing definition of component		-1

So choose either choose SCT and the variable you haven't discussed like behavior or choose cognitivism and memory system like long-term memory that you did not discuss.		
EDF 4210 Educational Psychology	2275	CSLPA Section 1 Draft	Any		Too many Raul and Anita Examples			Now for section 2 I don't want any examples of Raul and Anita. Save those for the final draft when we discuss strategies for students who speak other languages.
